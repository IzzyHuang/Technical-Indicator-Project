# Technical-Indicator-Project

## Challenges:

- Come up with a good objective function
- Figure out how to condense Bollinger band into one useful feature
- Use PCA and SVD to determine the orthogonality of the technical indicators 

## Plans for 3/6:
- Izzy: Figure out how to solve the jump discontinuity issue
        implement the Sharpe ratio column 
- Mia: calculating the variance of the stock for Sharpe ratio
       validating our upper and lower bound hypothesis
